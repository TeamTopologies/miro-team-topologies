# Team Topologies web plugin for Miro

This plugin provides you ready to use shapes to build ([Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com)).

Based on some of the ideas in the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton [@matthewskelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) and Manuel Pais [@manupaisable](https://github.com/manupaisable).
Trying to align with the templates available in [this repo](https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Team-Shape-Templates#available-team-shapes)

Once the needed shapes are into your whiteboard, you can edit them as much as you want (since these are standard Miro shapes):
