# Team Topologies web plugin for Miro

This plugin provides you ready to use shapes to build ([Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com)).

Based on some of the ideas in the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton [@matthewskelton](https://github.com/matthewskelton) and Manuel Pais [@manupaisable](https://github.com/manupaisable).
Trying to align with the templates available in [this repo](https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Team-Shape-Templates#available-team-shapes)

# How it works

You can try the official plugin directly from [Miro Marketplace](https://miro.com/marketplace/team-topologies/).

Setup the Team Topologies icon from your library

![Find the Team Topologies icon from your library](readme-img/001.import_from_library.gif)

Start to drag & drop the shapes you need

![Start Drag & Drop the needed shapes](readme-img/002.Start_drag_and_drop_new.gif)

Once you have added the required shapes onto your whiteboard, you can edit them as much as you want (since these are standard Miro shapes):
